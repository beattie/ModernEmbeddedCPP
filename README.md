# ModernEmbeddedCPP
Modern C++ Embedded code

Eclipse projects to excersize Modern C++ (14, 17, 20) in a small embedded environment.

This repo includes an Eclipse Workspace that includes the projects. The Eclipse projects actually reside in the repo at the same level as the workspace. This arrangement is a work in progress.

Currently using Eclipse:
Version: 2022-12 (4.26.0)
Build id: 20221201-1913o

Tools gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10 (probably any reasonably recent arm-none-eabi toolchain)
OpenOCD 0.11.0 from apt packages

I'm a Vi user so I use the Vrapper eclipse plugin
