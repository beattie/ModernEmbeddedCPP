# ModernEmbeddedCPP
Modern C++ Embedded code

Eclipse projects to excersize Modern C++ (14, 17, 20) in a small embedded environment.

This repo includes an empty Eclipse Workspace. I tried to include the **.metadate** directory
but that is just too dynamic for me to be comfortable with including that in the repo.
I'm working on other approaches but for now I'll just have to import projects. 

Currently using Eclipse:  
Version: 2023-12 (4.30.0)  
Build id: 20231201-2043  

Currently I have a whole boatload of plugins I need to identify which ones a needed.

Tools gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10 (probably any reasonably recent arm-none-eabi toolchain)
OpenOCD 0.11.0 from apt packages

I'm a Vi user so I use the Vrapper eclipse plugin
