# ModernEmbeddedCPP
Modern C++ Embedded code

Eclipse projects to excersize Modern C++ (14, 17, 20) in a small embedded environment.

*My intention is to be able to clone an Eclipse project directly, this is not working right now.*

This repo includes the complete Eclipse configuration that I use which may or may not suit your needs. I'm thinking about other ways to handle thin.

Also these projects rely on external tools, Compilers, Debuggers, etc... I'll be adding information about those tools.

Currently using Eclipse:
Version: 2022-12 (4.26.0)
Build id: 20221201-1913
